# AnagramChecker
Write a program that checks if the two passed command-line arguments are anagrams.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kwaxi/AnagramChecker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kwaxi/AnagramChecker)

The program shall support the following command-line interface:

```shell
$ anagram.exe WORD_1 WORD_2
```

The program shall operate case-insensitive. You may either convert the input to upper- or lowercase using `toupper()` or `tolower()`.

To check if a word is valid, you may use `isalpha()` on each character (thus, your program may only support English words or transliterations that just use a-z and/or A-Z).

In the case of the two words being anagrams, your program shall return 0. In the case of the two words not being anagrams, your program shall return -1. In the case of an error, your program shall return -2.

## Checking Method
Implement the anagram checking functionality as follows:

For each natural number, there is only one way to represent it as a product of prime numbers (=factorization). Any permutation of these prime factors leads to the same product. This anagram checker makes use of this property.

Create a table that maps each allowed character to a unique prime number, for example:

| character | prime |
| :---: | :---: |
| E | 2 |
| R | 3 |
| T | 5 |
| S | 7 |
| A | 11 |
| ... | ... |

The word STARE can now be represented as 7 * 5 * 11 * 3 * 2 = 2310

The word TEARS (an anagram) is represented as 5 * 2 * 11 * 3 * 7 = 2310

The word STARS (not an anagram) is represented as 7 * 5 * 11 * 3 * 7 = 8085

Two words that are anagrams result in the same product of their primes.

Note 1

---
The products for larger words get quite big. Use `uint64_t` from
`<stdint.h>` to store the numbers in the character â†’ prime table
and for the product.

Additionally, use the fact that some characters occur more often than others to map the more frequent characters to the lower
primes.

Note 2

---
Try to find a way to detect when a multiplication overflow occurs,
that is, when a multiplication product gets to large for `uint64_t` (larger than 18446744073709551616)


## Example Executions

```shell
$ anagram.exe word drow
"word" and "drow" are anagrams
$ anagram.exe word draw
"word" and "draw" are not anagrams
$ anagram.exe
Usage: anagram.exe WORD_1 WORD_2
$ anagram.exe word drow draw
Usage: anagram.exe WORD_1 WORD_2
```
